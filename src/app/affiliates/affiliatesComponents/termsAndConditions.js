                      As a small, do-it-yourself (DIY) business, we reserve the right to change the affiliate payout rate, program structure, or any other terms at any time. This means that percentages, rates, and even the availability of the platform could change in the future based on the business needs.

                      While we strive to provide a seamless experience, there may be instances where your referral balance is adjusted or reset. Although we will do our best to maintain transparency, please be aware that your earnings could change without notice if unforeseen technical or business challenges arise.

We assure you that our goal is to keep things running as smoothly as possible, but being a DIY business, we can&apos;t guarantee consistency at all times.
